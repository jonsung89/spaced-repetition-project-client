### What is Amgi?

- Amgi is a simple flash card that uses spaced repetition algorithms to make learning much more efficient and longer-lasting.
- Amgi is especially useful for language learners who want an efficient way to learn vocabularies.

### Minimum Variable Product

- For now, Amgi will only have 10 things for you to try and memorize.
- Tell the app whether or not you remember something by selecting 'Yes' or 'No'.

### Additional features to add

- You will be able to create custom decks and cards. Use it to study medical terminology, the periodic table, or anything else that fits on a card.
